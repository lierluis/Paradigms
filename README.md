# Paradigms

## Procedural (C++)

#### 1. Plateau program (max sequence length)

This program finds the longest sequence of identical numbers in a sorted array.

#### 2. Parabolic Aproximation

This program reads 3 points on a curve: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)
and computes y values for n=40 equidistant x values such that
x1 <= x <= x3 using Cramer's rule and Lagrange interpolation.

#### 3. Array Processing (array reduction)

This program reduces an array by eliminating from it all
values that are equal to the three highest unique integers.

#### 4. Integer Plot Function

This program displays an arbitrary positive
integer n using big characters of size 7x7.

#### 5. Iteration vs Recursion

This program searches through an array and finds a number using
a binary search algorithm both iteratively and recursively.
